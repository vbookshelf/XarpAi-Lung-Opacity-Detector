# XarpAi Lung Opacity Detector
An Ai powered desktop app that auto detects opacities on chest x-rays.

Opacities on chest x-rays are characteristic signs of TB and Pneumonia. This app is a prototype high volume diagnosis support tool. It auto analyzes chest x-rays and highlights potential opacities. Radiologists can then review the highlighted areas and use their clinical judgment to make a final diagnosis. This is simply a flask app running on the desktop.
